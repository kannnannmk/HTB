1. Normal Nmap command on the target 
   nmap -sC -sC -p- -A <target>
2. List of ports open are
   SMB port - Samba 3.x to 4.x --> Port 139
   Open SSH - Not vulnerable  --> Port 22
   vsftpd 2.3.4 --> Port 21

   vsftpd has exploit available for its version 2.3.4. But is is not working since 
   it accepts only anonymous login

3. Trying out exploit for SMB - Samba 3.x to 4.x (3.0.20 as per scan results)

Using "searchspolit Samba 3.0" we have found the exploit and got CVE via google.

Use this payload https://github.com/amriunix/CVE-2007-2447

Makesure to download pySMB via pip before running the exploit

Mention the LHOST LPORT RHOST RPORT,  listen in NC, now we got root and flag in root.txt
