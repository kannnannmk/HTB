1. OS requirement and tool requirement
   1. Windows 10/8/7 where application is running.
      Tools - Immunity debuger
   2. Kali linux
       Python script for fuzzing
       
 2. Run the application, attach process to Immunity debugger.
    1. Immunity is in paused state, click button to run it.
    2. While it is running, send fuzzing python script containg payload (Say 5000 or 3000)
    3. Make sure the application crashed and immunity debugger paused
    4. Now send unique byters of 3000 or 5000, to find the EIP register address (unique string can be create using pattern create)
    5. We have found maxium size of ESP is 524
  
 3. Fill EIP memory
      1. Fuzz with 524 * A + B * 4 + c * (random number)  --> random number = 3000 - 524 - 4 --> not sure if this is required.
      2. Check if EIP is filled with B (42)
      3. Now we have found EIP filled with B
      4. Rest of the space filled with
