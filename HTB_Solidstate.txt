Simple exploitation using Telnet and James exploit
We can login as root via telnet using root:root credentials
telnet 10.10.10.51 4555 //James 2.3.2 open in this port
Here we can set password for all users
telnet 10.10.10.51 110 // POP3 server, where we can login as normal user
We can find Mindy user's SSH password
Login as mindy using SSH
ss mindy@10.10.10.51 sh
sh is used to get an interactive shell
cd into /temp
execute '/bin/dash' --> we are root

Refer IPPSEC and other walkthrough.

I can complete only half of the machine, as machine doesn't respond with interactive shell when using sh or bash command
