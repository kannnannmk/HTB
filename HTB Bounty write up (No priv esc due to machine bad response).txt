1. Run the intensive nmap 
nmap -sC -sV -A -p- <target ip>

resulted in Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5 at port 80

Since it is IIS, so there is possibility for the existance of directories
.asp, .aspx., .html. So we use gobuster for directory brut forcing. 

2. Parallely run a gobuster scan using below command

gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.93 -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt 
-t 30 -x .aspx,.asp,.html

3. We have found page at /transfer.aspx there we can upload the files.

Since it is .aspx, we try uploading and web.config files 

the web.config file has filetransfer command for reverse shell psbounty.ps1

so we just uploaded the web.config, that transfers .ps1 powershell script
(find the web.config and powerup.ps1 exploit in github) that givers reverse shell

there we can find 'whoami /privall' or systeminfo to get configuration

we can either use exploit based on system or JuicyPotato.exe 

This machine was hanging after this process, so not able to proceed
